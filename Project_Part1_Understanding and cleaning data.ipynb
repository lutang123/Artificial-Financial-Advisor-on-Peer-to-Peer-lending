    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "LendingClub is the first and largest online peer-to-peer ('P2P') platform to facilitate lending and borrowing of unsecured loans. As explained by Wikipedia:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000  and  $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal of this project**: Build a machine learning model that can help investor reduce the investment risk by building a portfolio with selected loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source** : Personal loan payment dataset from LendingClub Corp, LC, available on [LendingClub Statistics](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset I am working on is from 2007 to 2019 quarter 2; In total, there are about 2.5 millions of loans in this data. Each row is one loan, and it covers an extensive amount of information on the borrower's side that was originally available to lenders when they made investment choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I used the all the data available including the recent loan data for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I want to analyze all the loan data to find insight about default rate and year trends.\n",
    "2. After researching, I found that for the loans that are issued in recent years, although the loan term is either 36 months or 60 months, there are many loans that are pre-paid or charged off before it is expired. Those are still the data that I can use in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The whole projects are separated in two parts, and this is part 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1 Understanding and Cleaning data, Identifying investment problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 2 Choosing the best model for investors\n",

    "1. This charged off rate and interest rate is the average for each grade based on statistic data. When an investor make investment decision, they will know the specific interest rate for each loan, but of course not charged off rate. And this is something we will trying to predict with our machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When a loan is charged off, it does NOT mean that the investor will lose all of their investment; The loan payment schedule is similar like a mortage (the bank gives you a loan for your house and you pay back principle and interest together every month for the same amount of money over the whole morgage term. You may Pre-pay when you start earn more money and you may also unable to pay continiously if you lose your job and then you are 'charged off', but the bank still get some money back). This can explain why the charged off rate is so high and even higher than interest rate. This makes it more difficult to calculate how much lost an investor could have based on average charged off rate. However, for a more conservative investor, one thing for sure is we want the charged off rate as low as possible even though it means we may miss some good investment oppotunity. Understanding this is important for this project, because this will determine which metric should be used in machine learning model. In this project, we want to make a machine leanrning model that make sure investors still make money if some of the loans are charged-off and investor lost all the principal and interests."

    "- From the first two chart, we can clearly see from 2008 to 2018, the number of loans issued increased sharply. After 2015, it continued to increase, but growth is more slowly. However 2018 has good growth compared with 2017. The average amount of per loan also increased from 2008 to 2018. This again proved the growth in popularity of Peer to Peer lending in the last decade. According to PwC, U.S. peer-to-peer lending platforms’ origination volumes have grown an average of 84% per quarter since 2007.

    "- The last two charts show the charged off rate decreased a little bit from 2007 to 2009, and since then it keeps going up, this means the risk of investment is becoming higher. Interest rate increased unitl 2013 and then went down."

    "In Part 1, we explored and analyzed our data, some of the key findings and indications are:\n",
    "- **The Charged Off rate for all the loans in average is 19.57%**. This means if we choose loans to invest randomly, we could have about 19% of Charged-Off rate. *We should build a model to select loans that are predicted as \"Fully_paid\" with less that 19% of mistake, i.e. false positive rate is less than 19%*. \n",

    "- Loans with **A** grade has about **5.9%** of Charged Off rate. This means if an investor only choose A loans to invest, there is still 5.9% of the chance that they will lose money. And at the same time, by investing only A loans will not guarantee good return because interest rate is low too. *We should make our model to be able to build an investment portforlio that gives higher return than if the investors only choose A loans randomly*.\n",
