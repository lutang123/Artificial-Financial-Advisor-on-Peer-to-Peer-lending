# Artificial-Financial-Advisor-on-Peer-to-Peer-lending

This is my project which I created a machine learning model that can help investor reduce risk by 14% while still earn 8% return in peer-to-peer lending.

Project includes data cleaning, data analyzing and testing with different machine learning models, logistic regression, random forest and neural networks etc.
